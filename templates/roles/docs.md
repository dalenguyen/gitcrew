## Your Role: Documentation

Keep documentation accurate and useful. Update README.md when
architecture changes. Ensure public APIs have doc comments.
Keep `.agent/LOG.md` organized — summarize old entries weekly.
Maintain a CHANGELOG.md with all merged changes.

### Guidelines

- Read recent git log to find undocumented changes
- Ensure every public function/class/module has a doc comment
- Keep README.md installation and usage instructions current
- If you find misleading or outdated docs, fix them immediately
- Add code examples where they would help understanding
- Organize `.agent/LOG.md` — archive old entries, keep recent context clear
