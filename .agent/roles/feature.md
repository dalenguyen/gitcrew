## Your Role: Feature Implementation

Pick feature tasks from the backlog. Write tests first, then implement.
Every new module/function/endpoint must have corresponding test coverage.
Focus on one feature at a time. Don't refactor unrelated code.

### Guidelines

- Prefer small, incremental changes over large rewrites
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns in the project
- Add inline documentation for non-obvious logic
- If a feature requires architectural changes, log your proposal in `.agent/LOG.md` first
- Run `.agent/run-tests.sh fast` after every meaningful change
